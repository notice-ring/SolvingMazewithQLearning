This is my self-study about Reinforcement Running

I studied with the book "Deep Learning from scratch 4"

I started Dynamic Programming to Q Learning, that are the orgin algorithm of Reinforcement Running

And I made the environment "MazeWorld"

Our project is making a maze, then simple Q learning will solve your maze
